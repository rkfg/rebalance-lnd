# rebalance-lnd

Using this script you can easily rebalance individual channels of your lnd node.

## Installation

This script needs an active lnd 0.9.0+ (https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) instance running.
If you compile lnd yourself, you need to include the `routerrpc` build tag.

Example:
`make tags="autopilotrpc signrpc walletrpc chainrpc invoicesrpc routerrpc"`

You need to have admin rights to control this node.
By default this script connects to `localhost:10009`, using the macaroon file in `~/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon`.
If you need to change this, please have a look at the optional arguments `--grpc` and `--lnddir`.

You need to install Python. The gRPC dependencies can be installed by running:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On some systems using Python 3, use pip3 instead:

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

  -r RATIO, --ratio RATIO
                        (default: 50) ratio for channel imbalance between 1
                        and 50, eg. 45 to only show channels (-l) with less
                        than 45% of the funds on the local (-i) or remote (-o)
                        side
  --ratio-to RATIO_TO   (default: 50) ratio for incoming channel imbalance
                        between 1 and 50.
  --ratio-from RATIO_FROM
                        (default: 50) ratio for outgoing channel imbalance
                        between 1 and 50.

list candidates:
  Show the unbalanced channels.

  -l, --list-candidates
                        list candidate channels for rebalance
  -o, --outgoing        lists channels with less than x% of the funds on the
                        remote side (see --ratio)
  -i, --incoming        (default) lists channels with less than x% of the
                        funds on the local side (see --ratio)

rebalance:
  Rebalance a channel. You need to specify at least the 'from' channel (-f)
  or the 'to' channel (-t).

  -f CHANNEL, --from CHANNEL
                        channel ID of the outgoing channel (funds will be
                        taken from this channel)
  -t CHANNEL, --to CHANNEL
                        channel ID of the incoming channel (funds will be sent
                        to this channel). You may also use the index as shown
                        in the incoming candidate list (-l -i).
  -e EXCLUDE, --exclude EXCLUDE
                        Exclude the given channel ID in route finding.
  -E EXCLUDENODE, --excludenode EXCLUDENODE
                        Exclude the given node ID in route finding.
  -F MAX_FEE_FACTOR, --max-fee-factor MAX_FEE_FACTOR
                        (default: 10) Reject routes that cost more than x
                        times the lnd default (base: 1 sat, rate: 1 millionth
                        sat) per hop on average
  --force               Force the amount of satoshis specified in --amount,
                        overriding the target balance of 50/50
  --deep                Try all edges, even if a node is consistenty expensive
  --path PATH           Specify the route as a list of pubkeys. Optionally
                        specify --from channel. --to is ignored.
  -s STAT, --stat STAT  Save rebalancing statistics to a CSV file
  -a AMOUNT, --amount AMOUNT
                        Amount of the rebalance, in satoshis. If not
                        specified, the amount computed for a perfect rebalance
                        will be used (up to the maximum of 4,294,967 satoshis)
  -p PERCENTAGE, --percentage PERCENTAGE
                        Set the amount to send to a percentage of the amount
                        required to rebalance. As an example, if this is set
                        to 50, the amount will half of the default. See
                        --amount.
```

### List of channels
Run `rebalance.py -l` (or `rebalance.py -l -i`) to see a list of channels which
can be rebalanced.
This list only contains channels where less than 50% of the total funds are on
the local side of the channel.

You can also see the list of channels where less than 50% of the total funds
are on the remote side of the channel by running `rebalance.py -l -o`.

Use `-r/--ratio` to configure the sensitivity ratio (default is 50 for 50%).
As an example, `rebalance.py -l -o -r 10` only shows channels where less than
10% of the total funds are on the remote side of the channel.

As an example the following indicates a channel with around 17.7% of the funds
on the local side:

```
(23) Channel ID:  123[...]456
Pubkey:           012345[...]abcdef
Local ratio:      0.176
Capacity:         5,000,000
Remote balance:   4,110,320
Local balance:    883,364
Amount for 50-50: 1,613,478
|=====                       |
```

By sending 1,613,478 satoshis to yourself using this channel, a ratio of 50% can be achieved.
This number is shown as "Amount for 50-50".

The last line shows a graphical representation of the channel. 
The total width is determined by the channel's capacity, where a channel with maximum capacity (16,777,215 satoshis)
occupies the full width of your terminal.
The bar (`=`) indicates the funds on the local side of the channel.

The number next to the channel ID (23 in the example) can be used to directly reference this channel.

### Rebalancing a channel
To actually rebalance a channel, run the script and specify the channel to send funds to (`-t`) or from (`-f`).
It is possible to use both `-t` and `-f`, but at least one of these arguments must be given.
You can also specify the amount to send (using `-a`).
You specify the channel(s) using the channel ID, as shown in the output of `rebalance.py`.

`rebalance.py -t 123[...]456 -a 1613478`

It is also possible to indicate the `--to/-t` channel by the number shown next to the channel ID (23 in the example).

`rebalance.py -t 23 -a 1613478`

If you do not specify the amount, the rebalance amount is determined automatically.
As an alternative to specify the amount you may also set a percentage of the rebalance amount using `-p`.
For example, the following command tries to sends 20% of the amount required to rebalance the channel:

`rebalance.py -t 23 -p 20`

The maximum amount you can send in one transaction currently is limited (by the protocol) to 4,294,967 satoshis.

## Docker

You can build this repository and provide the LND directory & LND RPC location through environment variables. Example for Docker Compose:

```yaml
  rebalance-lnd:
    build: https://github.com/accumulator/rebalance-lnd.git
    environment:
      - GRPC_LOCATION=lnd:10009
      - LND_DIR=/lnd
    user: 1000 # example
    volumes:
      - /path/to/lnd:/lnd:ro
